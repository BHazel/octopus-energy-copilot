The Octopus Energy API works with dates and times in ISO 8601 format and requires them in a period with start date and end date.
The start and end dates require both a date and time.
In situations where the user does not provide a time:
* If start and end dates are provided but a time on either is not provided, you should set the start time to 00:00 of the start date, if missing, and 00:00 of the following day of the end date, if missing.
* If a single date is provided then the start and end times should be 00:00 of the start date and 00:00 of the following day respectively.
In situations where the user does not provide a year:
* Assume the current year, which you should get if not provided in context.
